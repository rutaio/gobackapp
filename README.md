# About this project

**Go Back App** is an early-stage SaaS MVP built for learning.

## Goals
- learn how to design and build a small SaaS product end-to-end
- practice engineering thinking, clean architecture and version control workflows
- deploy a real product using modern tools (Vercel + Supabase)
- explore tools that help small business owners reduce information overload and maintain consistency across their threads of work

The codebase is evolving in public.  
Some parts are experimental, unfinished, or intentionally simple.  
This project may become private or change structure as it evolves.

I’m documenting not only *what* I build, but also *why*.  
This documentation is primarily for myself, my mentor and other developers who may find it useful.

## Structure
- `/frontend` — React + TypeScript app deployed on Vercel (production + staging)
- `/backend` — Early Express starter (not used in Phase 1)

## Backend (Phase 1)
- Phase 1 is frontend-only
- Supabase is used as backend-as-a-service for auth and database
- The `/backend` folder is kept as a placeholder for possible Phase 2 development

## Feedback & collaboration

If you’re a developer, creator, or small business owner who resonates with the problem this project explores, I’d love to hear your thoughts.

This project is still early, and feedback or conversations are welcome.
