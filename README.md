# My Mini SaaS Project

A small SaaS-style application: Go Back App.

## Structure
- /backend  → Supabase
- /frontend → React + TypeScript hosted on Vercel (staging and production).

## Goals
- Build an MVP that solves a real problem for small business owners: information overload and lack of consistency when moving between their threads of work.
- Learn product development workflow
- Practice engineering mindset and clean architecture
