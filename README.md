# My Mini SaaS Project: Go Back App
- A small SaaS-style web application designed to help small business owners reduce information overload and maintain consistency across their threads of work.

## Structure
- /frontend: React + TypeScript app deployed on Vercel (production + staging).
- /backend (not used in Phase 1): Contains an early Express starter, kept for potential future development. Phase 1 uses Supabase as backend-as-a-service, which lives outside this folder.

## Goals
- Build an MVP that solves a real problem for small business owners
- Learn end-to-end product development workflow
- Practice engineering mindset, clean architecture and version control workflows
- Deploy a real product using modern tools (Vercel + Supabase)

## Backend Status (Phase 1)
- The /backend folder is currently not used.
- Phase 1 is frontend-only and integrates directly with Supabase for auth & database.
- The backend folder remains as a placeholder for future development in Phase 2 if needed.
